HasMarkup
=========

I had a few markup related thing in my blog. I intended to yank them out to be more generalized. For great justice, and all.

Perhaps you intend yourself to have some markup in your model, say it's markdown, and say it's required or not, and it's cached or not.

This plugin helps you do such things.


Example
=======

  has_markup :content, :syntax => :markdown, :required => true, :cache => true
